This challenge is about using data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## Installation and Setup

I have installed and imported all the necessary libraries and dependencies for data Visualization and Plotting.

The overall trend indicates a positive slope and shows an increase in housing units from 372560 to 384242 in the period observed between 2010-2016.

The Lowest gross rent reported was 1239 in the year 2010.

In 2011 there was a drop in the average sale price per square foot!

The gross rent increased during that year to 1530!

The average sale price per square foot in the Anza Vista neighborhood was less in 2016 than in 2012!

The trend in the rental income growth shows an increase in rent across all neighborhoods as compared to fluctuations in the sale price with some neighborhoods having a lower average sale price per square foot over time and this holds for all neighborhoods!


## Summary

Based on the visualizations I can share insights regarding the average rental income and sales prices per square foot and plot the data on an interactive map outlining the best potential neighborhoods for investment.
